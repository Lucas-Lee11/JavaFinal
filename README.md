Compile by using 'javac \*.java'

Execute by using 'java Calc'

#Info

This is a calculator designed to handle complex numbers.

It will process addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square roots, cos, sin, and tan of complex inputs


Please keep in mind the order of operations and ensure that there are no implied operations (i.e. '3(2)' will not be valid, instead use '3\*2')

This calculator uses radians. Use the custom function "torad()" in the input for conversion to radians (e.g. 'sin(torad(30))' will return 0.5 + 0.0i
